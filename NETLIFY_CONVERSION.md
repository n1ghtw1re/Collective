## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
- [ ] Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- [ ] Test that `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] Confirm all environment variables are documented

### 2. Gather Required Information
You'll need these details during setup:
- **GitHub repository URL**: `https://github.com/n1ghtw1re/n1ghtw1re-site`
- **Custom domain**: Your domain name (e.g., `n1ghtw1re.com`)
- **Supabase project URL**: `https://jrkhqqafpkykgribayzq.supabase.co`
- **Supabase anon key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

## üèóÔ∏è Part 1: Netlify Site Setup

### Step 1: Create Netlify Account & Connect Repository

1. **Sign up/Login to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up using your GitHub account (recommended)

2. **Import Your Project**
   - Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
   - Select your `n1ghtw1re-site` repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

**Build Settings Configuration:**
```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
```

**Advanced Build Settings:**
- Node version: 18 or higher
- Package manager: npm

### Step 3: Deploy Initial Version
- Click "Deploy site"
- Wait for initial deployment (5-10 minutes)
- Note the temporary Netlify URL (e.g., `magical-unicorn-123456.netlify.app`)

---

## üåê Part 2: Custom Domain Configuration

### Step 1: Add Your Custom Domain to Netlify

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to your site ‚Üí "Domain settings"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain: `n1ghtw1re.com`
   - Click "Verify" and "Add domain"

2. **Configure DNS (If domain is managed elsewhere):**
   If your domain DNS is managed outside Netlify:
   - Add a CNAME record: `www` pointing to your Netlify subdomain
   - Add an ALIAS/ANAME record: `@` pointing to your Netlify subdomain
   
   If using Netlify DNS:
   - Follow Netlify's nameserver instructions
   - Update nameservers at your domain registrar

### Step 2: Enable HTTPS
- Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Verify HTTPS works on your custom domain

---

## üîß Part 3: Supabase Configuration for Production

### Step 1: Update Supabase URL Configuration

**CRITICAL**: You must update Supabase settings for your production domain.

1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Navigate to your project: `jrkhqqafpkykgribayzq`

2. **Update Authentication URLs**
   - Go to "Authentication" ‚Üí "URL Configuration"
   - **Site URL**: `https://n1ghtw1re.com`
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add both:
     - `https://n1ghtw1re.com`
     - `https://n1ghtw1re.com/**`
     - `https://www.n1ghtw1re.com`
     - `https://www.n1ghtw1re.com/**`

3. **Update CORS Settings (if needed)**
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "API"
   - Ensure your domain is allowed in CORS settings

### Step 2: Environment Variables (None Needed!)
**Good news**: Your app doesn't use environment variables! The Supabase URL and keys are hardcoded in the client configuration, so no additional setup is required.

---

## üîÑ Part 4: Deployment Optimization

### Step 1: Configure Netlify Build Settings

Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://jrkhqqafpkykgribayzq.supabase.co; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://jrkhqqafpkykgribayzq.supabase.co wss://jrkhqqafpkykgribayzq.supabase.co;"

[[headers]]
  for = "/static/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### Step 2: Performance Optimizations

1. **Enable Asset Optimization**
   - In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí "Site settings" ‚Üí "Build & deploy"
   - Enable "Asset optimization"
   - Check: Minify CSS, Minify JS, Compress images

2. **Configure Branch Deploys**
   - Set production branch to `main` or `master`
   - Enable automatic deploys from GitHub
